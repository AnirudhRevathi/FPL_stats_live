Project Summary
Created an interactive Fantasy Premier League statistics tool that retrieves real-time player data and displays filtered results based on position and team selection. This application helps users make data-driven decisions when drafting players for their fantasy teams by providing key stats like player costs, total points, goals scored, assists, and clean sheets in a user-friendly interface.
Technical Skills Demonstrated:

API Integration: Connected to the Fantasy Premier League API to fetch current season data
Data Processing: Used Pandas for data manipulation, merging, filtering, and transformation
GUI Development: Built a responsive interface with Tkinter featuring radio buttons, dropdown menus, and scrollable results
Python Programming: Implemented functions, conditional logic, and lambda functions
Data Visualization: Formatted complex data into readable tabular output using the tabulate library
HTTP Requests: Used the requests library to retrieve JSON data from external sources

This project enhanced my learning to combine data retrieval, processing, and visualization skills to create a practical tool that solves a real-world problem for fantasy sports enthusiasts.
